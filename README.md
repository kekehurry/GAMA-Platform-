# 简介

GAMA is a modeling and simulation development environment for building spatially explicit agent-based simulations.

* [**Multiple application domains:**](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/Home#multiple-application-domains) Use GAMA for whatever application domain you want.
* [**High-level and Intuitive Agent-based language:**](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/Home#high-level-and-intuitive-agent-based-language) Write your models easily using GAML, a high-level and intuitive agent-based language.
* [**GIS and Data-Driven models:**](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/Home#gis-and-data-driven-models) Instantiate agents from any dataset, including GIS data, and execute large-scale simulations \(up to millions of agents\).
* [**Declarative user interface:**](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/Home#declarative-user-interface) Declare interfaces supporting deep inspections on agents, user-controlled action panels, multi-layer 2D/3D displays & agent aspects.

Its latest version, **1.8.1**, can be freely [downloaded](https://gama-platform.github.io/download) or [built from source](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/), and comes pre-loaded with several models, [tutorials](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/Tutorials) and a complete [on-line documentation](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/Overview).
